## Midsize Program Building
1. 32 Bits
	1. char - 1 byte
	1. short - 2 bytes
	1. int  - 4 bytes
	1. long - 4 bytes
	1. float - 4 bytes
	1. double - 8 bytes
1. What is a Makefile and why do we use them?
	- a script that guides the user to make the program properly
2. What is the standard way to organize a project?
	- src
	- include
	- lib
3. What is the purpose of a README
	- contains instructions details, and help for a software program.
4. What goes in the lib directory?
	- contains kernel modules and those shared library images.
5. What goes in the src directory?
	- Source code files.
6. What goes in the include directory?
	-  the headers exposed for public consumption.
7. Why do we break a program into multiple files?	
	1. Organization
	1. Flexibility
	1. Network reasons
1. Bootstrapping
	1. A compiler that can compile itself
## Lifecycle of an executable 
1. Source
1. Lex (Text into Tokens)
1. Parse (Tokens into Parse Tree)
1. Compile (Abstract Syntax Tree)
1. Assemble (Turns Tree into .o)
1. Link (links all programs)
1. Load (loads the executable)
##  Datastructures
1. Big O notation -  O(g(x)) x->n
2. Binary Conversions
	- If the decimal number being divided is even then the result will be whole and the remainder will be equal to “0”. If the decimal number is odd then the result will not divide completely and the remainder will be a “1”.
3. Hash Sets
	- What is the advantage of a HashSet?
		- hashing stores elements quickly
		- contain unique elements only
		- fast search/add function O(1).
	- What is the disadvantage of a HashSet?
		- Non-synchronized
		- Doesnt maintain insertion order
	- What are some applications of a HashSet? 
		- For add and serching quickly. (Passwords)
	- What design choices can you make that affect the 	performance of a HashSet What is a hash algorithm?
		- Have a key find the value
		- Search is fast. (O(1))
		- Hard to implement
	- What is a hash algorithm?
		- while hash is the exact encoded number/text
	- What is a prehash algorithm?
		- Prehash gets the index
4. B-Trees 
	- What is a b-tree?
		- Degree - from 1 to n(how many nodes you can have in a group).
			- 2nd degree
			- 3rd degree
		- Split when the amount of numbers in tree is == to degree.
		- *insertion- O(logn)
		- Find - O(logn)
		- Remove- O(logn)
		- https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html 
	- When would you use a b-tree?
		- Self Balancing 
		- Range Queries
		- Comparisons
	- What is the advantage of a b-tree over a hash table/set?
		- Disadvantage of B-tree is slow on the search. 
## Debugging
1. What is a debugger?	
	- assists in the detection and correction of errors in a program
2. What is gdb and why is it useful?
	- GDB allows you to run the program up to a certain point, then stop and print out the values of certain variables at that point, or step through the program one line at a time and print out the values of each variable after executing each line.
3. What is a  breakpoint and why is it useful? 
	- allow you to breakj execution when the value stored at a memory location changes.
4. What is a stack trace and why is it useful?
	- a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time
5. Why not just printf your way through life?
	- 
6. What role does program state play in debugging? 
	- The state is the information remebered by the program. While debugging it goes through each state in the manner it would at run time to check if things run smoothly. 
7. Why are we interested in looking at program state?
	-
8. What about the design of C/C++ makes inspecting state 
difficult?
	- 

## Networking
1. What is a network?
	- A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. There are many types of computer networks, including the following: local-area networks (LANs): The computers are geographically close together 
1. Limitations of Networking.
	1. Through put- how much information you are sending at a given moment.
	1. band width - How much information we could transfer
	1. Latency - how long it takes to go there and back
1. What is a Vector?
	- a vector was added to C++ as a safer and more powerful form of arrays
1. What is a protocol and why do we need them?
	- allow computers to communicate with other computers without users having to know what is happening in the background.
1. How do we use protocols in everyday life?
	- ie. grocery store
	- ie. kitchens
1. Why can’t we just send data to a server and expect the server to understand?
	- The serve has a different syntax so there has to be a protocol
1. What is compression/decompression and why do we do it?
	- lossless compression - turning a file into a smaller one to save storage and to send info faster. is reversible
	- Lossly compression - turns a file into a smaller file. Non-reversible.
1. What resources do we have to be concerned with in a networking context
	- 
1. What additional dangers are there w.r.t. transmitting and receiving data?
	- 
1. How do we send a C++ object or struct over a network?
	- serialization
1. What is serialization / deserialization.
	- Serialization is the process of turning an object in memory into a stream of bytes so you can do stuff like store it on disk or send it over the network.
	- Deserialization is the reverse process: turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory.
1. Why we do serializiation.
	- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream so that it can be saved in any physical file like (XML) or can be saved in Database
1. learn an example of protocols
1. HTML protocol
1. HTTP 
	- put, get, post, and delete
1. Example Program- serialize by hand
1. At the very center of the serial operation is a bit wise opertion.
1. Resources
	- Compression
		- lossless- can be reversed
		- lossly- mp3
		- compression ratio - compressed bytes/ original bytes
		- Cant compress everything
		- Decompress- is a mappin from the small thing to the large thing.
		- MP3- humans cant hear every frequency. MP3 takes those frequencies and truncates them. Bass gets flat, Percussions get lighter

1. Difference between Parse Tree and Abstract Tree
	1. Parse
		```
		//Parse tree creates heirarchy of tokens
		x = 7+32;		/> Variable -> x
		root->statement-> = 			/> Num - > 7
						\> Expresion - OP - > +
										\>num  />2
											   \>3
											```
	2. AST(abstract syntax tree)
		```
		x = 7 + 32

		root->Assignment/> var:x
						\>MatExpr->Add/>7
									  \>32
									  ```
1. Bit 
	1. int-> Float  2.55 = 255x10^-2
		1. 255 - 2
		1. 00 00 00 00
		1. 00 00 00 - 255
		1. 00 - -2
		1. 255 - in hex = 00 00 FF 00
		1. c=0
		1. c|ff<<1*8
		1. 00 00 FF 82 => 2.55

# Class Notes CSE109
**Reminders:**
    * Assignment 2 will be useful knowledge on exam
    * Assignment 2 due July 24
# Terminal Commands
* "-a" - print all hidden directories
*".vscode"
*"-l" -  prints out extra information
*"ls-d"-  lists all directories
*"-r" - lisit revers order
```
 ls -la == ls -l -a

 > ./myls -a -l
```
 argc = 
```
 > .myls -al

```
 argc = 2
 argv[0] = myls
 argv[1] = "-al"
 argv[1][0] = -
 argv[1][1] = a

1. list arguments in any arguments 
2. choose however many arguments we want.
3. Compound arguments


## Program 2
- Use github to get information about the project
- Look at other people programs and compare and use bit of code to help.

# Structure (aka. Struct)
- The **struct** construct defines a new type, which can be used to declare a variable with subitems. 
- Each type may be any type like int or char. Each struct subitem is called a **data member**. For a declared variable, each struct data member can be accessed using ".", known as a **member access** operator, sometimes called **dot notation**.


```
#include <stdio.h>

struct Books{
    char title[50];
    char author[50];
    char subject[100];
    int book_id;
};
int main(){
    struct Books Book1;
    struct Books Book2;
}
sizeof(book) = 204 bytes;

Struct Book* my_book_ptr;
Struct Book my_book;
my_book.title;
//my_book_ptr.title;  //wrong
(*my_book_ptr).title;
my_book_ptr->title
```
**c++** - Book my_book = new Book(author, title, subject, id);

**c** - struct Book my_book;

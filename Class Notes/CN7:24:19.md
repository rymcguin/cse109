# Hash Set v. Map

- **Hash Map**-  this connects a key to a value. The key is the address(or a door that leads you somewhere). The value is the the important information that you want. Can only have a 1 to 1 relationship between a key and value.
    - The *hash table* maintains these relationships by using the *hash function*

```
my_hash.insert(5);
my_hash.insert(3);
my_hash.insert(5);
```
- Since 5 has already been inserted, you cant insert another 5. You would have to parse your linked list to check if there are no repeating numnbers.

-**Generics** - 

# Classes

```
template<class T>
Class LinkedList{
    public:
        LinkedList();
        ~LinkedList();
        insert(T //int ,value);
        find(T value);
    protected:
        int length;
        ListNode* head;
        ListNode* tail;
}
Class List Node{
    public:
        Npde(T value); //T could be raplaced by "int" in all cases
        ~Node();
        ListNode* next;
}
```
- **Metaprogramming** -  is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

## Project
- lib - external Library
- include - internal libraries
- src - source code
- build:   
    - objects - files that are need to build program
    - bin - executable file that will ultimately be run by the user. 

**Command line arguments**
- g++ -c src/main.cpp -I include -o build/objects/main.o
-c
- g++ LinkedList.o main.o linked_list_test
- 
- compile an object file
- compile a main file
- link the files

#Class Notes 7/29

# Data Storage methods
- linked list:
	- Search - O(n)
	- Insert - O(n)-O(1)
- Hash Set:
	- Search - O(1)
	- Insert - O(1)

## Steps of hash set
1. Open File
2. Read in URL and turn into int
3. Store integer in Vec<int>

```
int hashed = HashSet::hash_str(url)
```
4. Close File

# Programming assignment 3
- 1 - linked lists  with four data points (1,000; 10,0000; 100,000; 1,000,000)
- 4 - hash sets with four data points each (1,000; 10,0000; 100,000; 1,000,000)
	- HS 1e3 (1,000; 10,0000; 100,000; 1,000,000)
	- HS 1e4
	- HS 1e5
	- HS 1e6
```
start = now();
end = now();
delta = end - start
```

## Warnings
- Start now
- Use a vector
-
# final
- short answer
- multiple choice
- fill ins
- stack and heap allocations
- Extra credit assignment
- 

# Compiler Directions
-meta language built ontop of C++.
- These are instructions to the compiler to tell it what to do.
- #ifndef
- #define
```
#ifndef _NAME //If not defined

//Code

#endif
```

## Good
- Set Membership
- Associating key-> val

## Bad
- Searching
- Comparing
- Range queries

# B-Tree
- Search - O(logn)
- Insert - O(logn)
- Parameterized by n(node cap)
	- n = 5

# Networking
**Networking**-  is a server that commmunicates with a client over a wire. It sends bytes through the wire to transfer information. **Protocol** tells the server how to interpret the information.

**Through put** - Determines How many bytes per second can be tranferd over the wire. 

**Band Width**- is the maximum when you order the plan of 10 megaBytes then that is the maximum you can transfer through. The through put is the curent amount being transfered. 

**Latency** - Choose a server that is actually physically closer to you. 

**Ping** -  how long it takes to send a byte to a server and back again. (Lower the better). 

Multiplr servers make a faster network. 

**cpmpression** the process of coding bits using fewer bits than original.
	-Lossless - completely revrsible. Compress and uncompress a file and being able to understand it. (ex. zip file)
	-Lossly- compress it but cant regain the original from the copy.

**Serialize**- converting an object into a byte string. A function that returns a vector unsigned chars. Takes in a message. 
**Deserialize**- converting a byte string back to an object. These functions are compliments. 

```Serializing an Integer

int I  = 952;
hex = 3B8;
```

# Networking
- Host- a server that communicates over the internet to another system called a client.
- Computers talking to eachother. They talk in bytes
- "Network Tapoology"
- Protocals-  invisible rules, we use them to lower the amount of attention we have to spend in our every day lives. Things flow naturally and things are were you expect. When Things dont line up protocals need to be changed. 
- Computers follow a very strict guidline or else everything will go wrong. All of the rules are very precisely defined and there are no deviations from the lines. 
- **Protocol** - The official system of rules governing communication between networked computers.

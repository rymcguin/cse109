**Reminders**
- Rust Language
- Implementation
- Ecosystem

## Rust Language
- Syntax - letters, numbers, symbols, sigils - form
- Semantics - they give meaning behind symbols. 
	- Syntax is a button, and semantics is what the botton does. 

## Implementation 
- writes parser/compiler
- writing runtime
- tests

## Ecosystem
- documentation
- libraries(stdlib)
- inter-operate
- repository
- tooling 

From source code to running program
-
1. lex
1. parse
1. compile
1. link
1. load

## Cargo 
- Is a package manager and a build tool for rust
- 
language implementation and specification can be different.
Language development projects have changed a lot over the years, it now include ecosystems.
rustc turns source code into a program
cargo is used to call rustc to get a final program
